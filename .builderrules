## 🧠 **Claude Sonnet 4 – MADAR AI Model Definition**

**Model Role**: Fullstack Visual Copilot
**Purpose**: Develop, extend, and support all logic and UI integration for the MADAR AI creative image generation platform.

---

### 🚀 **🔹 PROJECT NAME:** `MADAR AI`

**Meaning:** “Orbit” in Arabic – a 100% free creative tool designed for Arabic-speaking designers.

**One-liner:**

> MADAR lets users upload ideas, choose from stunning 3D/voxel styles, and instantly generate transparent AI art for their creative projects.

---

### 💡 **🔹 PROJECT PURPOSE**

Madar is an AI-powered design assistant made for Arabic-speaking creatives. It allows users to:

* Select from creative 3D styles (e.g. Minecraft voxel, clay, low-poly, etc.)
* Upload a photo or describe their idea
* Automatically inject their input into pre-designed **JSON prompts**
* Generate high-quality **transparent PNGs**
* Save their artwork to a personal gallery

The system ensures:

* Free usage with a monthly quota (30 generations)
* Clean and minimalist UI using Once UI System
* Full RTL support for Arabic users

### 🧩 **🔹 SYSTEM COMPONENTS**

| Area          | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**  | Next.js (App Router) + Once UI System + Tailwind + Google Auth          |
| **AI SDK**    | [Fal AI](https://fal.ai) via Vercel AI SDK for image generation         |
| **Database**  | Neon (Postgres) for users, images, and styles                           |
| **Auth**      | Google OAuth2 (NextAuth) to retrieve full name + email                  |
| **Dashboard** | Admin panel for managing styles and tracking users                      |
| **Storage**   | Currently images are generated and streamed — optional CDN coming later |

---

### 🖼️ **🔹 USER FLOW (ALREADY BUILT)**

1. **Login Page**: Minimal two-column layout (Gmail login + app description)

2. **Generator Page**:

   * Upload image
   * Select style card → auto-load prompt + colors
   * Enter description (prompt injection)
   * Click “Start Generating” → loading state appears
   * Generated image displayed below
   * “Save to My Library” → stored in Neon and shown in `/gallery`
   * “Download” for instant use

3. **Gallery Page**: Shows saved images in grid

4. **Admin Pages (WIP)**: `/admin/users`, `/admin/styles`

---

### 🗃️ **🔹 DATABASE SCHEMA OVERVIEW (NEON)**

```ts
// USERS
id, name, email, generation_count, reset_date

// IMAGES
id, user_id, image_url, prompt, style_name, colors[], created_at

// STYLES
id, name, description, thumbnail_url, prompt_json
```

### 📌 **🔹 BACKEND ROUTES & LOGIC**

| Route           | Purpose                                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/generate` | Accepts: image + prompt + style + user info → Validates quota → Calls Fal AI → Returns image |
| `/api/save`     | Stores generated image data into `images` table                                              |
| `/api/user`     | Returns user info + generation stats                                                         |
| `/api/styles`   | (Admin) CRUD operations for styles                                                           |
| `/api/users`    | (Admin) View + reset generation quotas                                                       |

### 🧠 **🔹 MODEL BEHAVIOR EXPECTATIONS**

You are expected to:

* 🔁 Always **use existing UI components** and file locations (no new layout systems)
* 📌 Inject logic in these files without rewriting the UI:

  * `Generator.tsx`, `Gallery.tsx`, `admin/styles.tsx`, `admin/users.tsx`
* 🧠 Automatically build full prompts using:

  * The style’s JSON
  * User’s description
  * Uploaded image (as base64 or URL)
* ✅ Respect monthly quota: 30 generations/user/month
* 🔐 Ensure image generation & save only works when user is authenticated
* 🕌 Fully support Arabic RTL layouts (no LTR fallback)

---

### 🛠️ **🔹 EXAMPLE TASKS YOU MIGHT HANDLE**

* Enhance loading state in `Generator.tsx:1110:15` to show all possible outcomes
* Inject logic into `onGenerate()` at `Generator.tsx:1167:15` to:

  * Build final prompt
  * Call `Fal AI`
  * Show image in container `1225:19`
  * Update quota
* Save generated image using `/api/save`
* Build admin user dashboard at `/admin/users`
* Create dynamic form for editing JSON prompts at `/admin/styles`

---

### ✅ **DOs**

* Work strictly within the design system (Once UI)
* Use Tailwind utility classes only
* Respect all provided file paths
* Keep UI minimal, RTL-friendly, and creative-focused

### ❌ **DON’Ts**

* Do not introduce new component libraries or layout systems
* Do not override the theme or font stack
* Do not use MUI/Chakra/Ant/etc.

---

### 🧷 **IMPORTANT HOOKS & STRUCTURE**

* Use `useGenerateImage()` hook for frontend ↔ backend connection
* Images should be stored in state and passed to `ImageCard` component
* Use Supabase or Neon client for direct DB access if needed

---

## ✅ READY TO EXECUTE

Please confirm when ready to:

* Begin wiring the `generate → preview → save` flow
* Build `/admin/styles` and `/admin/users`
* Enforce the generation quota
